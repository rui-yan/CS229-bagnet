# CS229-final-project

Final project for CS229

- `run_bagnet33.py` is the python script used to train, test, validate and evaluate the bagnet33 baseline model.
- `run_resnet50.py` is the python script used to train, test, validate and evaluate the resnet50 baseline model.
- Performance of each model is stored in the `model_performance_results` directory, including loss_acc_plots, terminal output, and model checkpoints.
